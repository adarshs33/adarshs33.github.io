ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a very serious condition with a mortality rate of more than 40% and afflicting more than 2 million people around the world every year. Prone positioning therapy has been shown to reduce the mortality by about 15%. However, it is not practiced widely in hospitals due to lack of necessary infrastructure. 
I worked on a project to develop an assistive device for prone positioning therapy as an intern at [Shira MedTech Pvt. Ltd](https://shiramedtech.com/). This device assists care providers in providing prone positioning therapy. The device provides benefit in 3 ways - 
1. Reduces operator load and makes the procedure simpler
2. Improves patient safety by preventing physical trauma and pneumothorax
3. Prevent pressure sores and corneal injuries

We are in the process of patenting this device! I will post updates soon. In the meantime, you can find an overview of the innovation process that we followed [here](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/Intern_PPT.pdf).
