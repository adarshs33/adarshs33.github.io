This was my first research project under the guidance of Prof. Asokan T and Karthik Chandrasekaran (PhD scholar, Robotics Lab). I worked on choosing suitable large displacement compliant joints and simulating them on Abaqus for identifying trends on axis drift and range of motion. This was also the first time I came across the concepts of negative stiffness and static balancing. I utilized these concepts to statically balance the mechanism within its' range of motion. This project was presented at the ASME Design of Medical Devices Conference 2018 at the University of Minnesota.
