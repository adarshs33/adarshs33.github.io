I worked on this project to improve my understanding of dynamics and control of a robot. The objective was to identify countermasses for precise static balancing of a 6 DoF robot master arm for teleoperation. I worked with Mathematica and SimScape to develop models for simulating the master arm. Here are the links for the Mathematica code and the SimScape model.
