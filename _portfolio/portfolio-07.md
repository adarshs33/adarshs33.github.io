This project was a part of my course ED6002 - Optimization Methods in Engineering Design. I worked on implementing the algorithm developed by Salcudean and Stocco to a 2 DOF palletizing robot to optimize the link lengths for maximizing the Global Isotropy Index within a workspace. You can find the code here. These are the links for the project [report](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/ED6002_Project_Report.pdf) and [PPT](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/ED6002_Project_PPT.pdf).
