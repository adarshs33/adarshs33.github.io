I worked on this project as an intern at Shira MedTech Pvt. Ltd. This device assists care providers in providing prone positioning therapy. The device provides benefit in 3 ways - 
1. Reduces operator load and makes the procedure simpler
2. Improves patient safety by preventing physical trauma and pneumothorax
3. Prevent pressure sores and corneal injuries

We are in the process of patenting this device! I will post updates soon
