This work was a part of my project for the course CY6008 - Medicinal Chemistry. In this project, HIV infection mechanism was studied & target HIV Protease was identified and its' action was reviewed. Mechanism of inhibition of Darunavir, an existing drug against HIV was examined. Further, analogues of Darunavir were designed & their interactions were investigated. Though I was not successful in improving the performance of the anti HIV drug, I learnt a huge amount about the techniques and methodology involved in synthesizing drugs.
