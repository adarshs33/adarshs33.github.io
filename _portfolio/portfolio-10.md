This work was a part of the course BT5011 - Biomaterials Engineering. I performed an extensive literature survey on prosthetic heart valves and proposed areas for future research involving endothelialization and tissue engineering. Here are the links for the project [report](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/BT5011_Project_Report.pdf) and [PPT](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/BT5011_Project_PPT.pdf).
