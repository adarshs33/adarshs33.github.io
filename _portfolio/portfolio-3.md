I was an active member of the team from 2016 - 2018. In my first year with the team, I was responsible for the designing the soil sample retrieval and analysis subsystem. I also headed the scientific analysis team and was responsible for designing experiments for detecting signs of life in the collected soil cache. In my second year, I co-headed the rover design team and also managed the team finances and sponsorship. I also drafted content for the team brochures, website and videos.
