This was a part of my course project for ED5315 - Introduction to Field & Service Robotics. I developed a prototype for a 2 DoF tool tip actuated through antagonistic pneumatic chambers. The design consisted of a compliant backbone with chambers on both sides of the backbone. You can find a full design description [here](https://adarshsomayaji.github.io/files/fsr_project.pdf). Credit to [Soft Robotics Toolkit](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/) for describing the methodology for modelling and fabricating soft robots.
