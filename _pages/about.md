Hello there! My name is Adarsh Somayaji. Welcome to my home on the web. 

I am a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras pursuing a dual degree in Engineering Design with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering. I am excited by the potential impact of robotics in the field of healthcare, particularly in developing medical devices that can be used in surgery, diagnosis and rehabilitation. I enjoy studying human physiology and developing models that explain the inner workings of this most complex system.   

I am currently working on developing a variable stiffness grasper as a part of my Masters thesis project. I am using my learnings from my previous project on compliant mechanisms to achieve this goal.

Thanks for stopping by!
